    "In more technical terms, the probability distribution is a description of a random phenomenon in terms of the probabilities of events. For instance, if the random variable X is used to denote the outcome of a coin toss (\"the experiment\"), then the probability distribution of X would take the value 0.5 for X = heads, and 0.5 for X = tails \n",

    "A probability distribution is specified in terms of an underlying sample space, which is the set of all possible outcomes of the random phenomenon being observed.

    "A <b>discrete probability distribution </b> (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes is discrete, such as a coin toss or a roll of dice) can be encoded by a discrete list of the probabilities of the outcomes, known as a probability mass function. \n",

    "On the other hand, a <b> continuous probability distribution </b> (applicable to the scenarios where the set of possible outcomes can take on values in a continuous range (e.g. real numbers), such as the temperature on a given day) is typically described by probability density functions (with the probability of any individual outcome actually being 0). The normal distribution is a commonly encountered continuous probability distribution.\n",
